I am a software engineer writing mostly in Python. My main professional interests are artifact-based build systems such as Pants and Bazel, Python ecosystem and tooling, and developer productivity. 

I am a maintainer of the [Pants build system](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants). To learn more about the project, read the [docs](https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs) and the [blog](https://blog.pantsbuild.org/), or watch my 1 hour [crash course on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9mHs1CPnGQ&t=2s). I love engaging with the community of Pants users in our Slack workspace and helping others improve their builds.
